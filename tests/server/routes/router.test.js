Here is the Jest unit test for your server/routes/router.js code using Supertest and jest mocking framework:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest'); // Import supertest to make HTTP requests 
// Here we will use 'jest' library with a custom expect method, so that the output looks like JUnit test results. This is needed for your entire testing suite - all tests should return this structure if not already set up by jest or another similar tool such as Mocha/Chai etc.. 
const { expect } = require('@jest/globals'); // Importing 'expect' from the global JEST object. This is a custom assertion library in Node, so it doesn’t need to be imported individually per each test file you write like import chalk or other packages do with npm modules
const { router } = require("../../../server/routes/router"); // Import your 'express' route (or whatever the name is)  from './yourFile.js'. It needs an initializer function that returns a Router object if it gets passed one in, otherwise undefined will be returned and Express won’t know to attach all routes anywhere by default
// Reset items before each test case block - necessary for every unit of work (or 'it') inside the describe/context ‘describe' method. This ensures your server is clean after a set up done in setup function or at start time, and you can re-run tests with different data without affecting previous ones
beforeEach(() => { resetItems() }); // Calling our custom initializer (if exists) before each test case block - the 'it' method. ‘describe', '.context','test'. If no setup function then it defaults to .only, only runs when a file is imported as module by node and not called directly in Node otherwise
// Test cases for your routes: All tests should return this structure if you don’t have any custom Jest assertions or similar tool set up. You can run all of these test files together with npm t (or jest -j 10), make sure they are independent and not dependent on each other's result, so that the entire suite runs without errors
describe("Routes", () => { // This is a block grouping tests for your routes. 'test', '.only','...'. When you add new features to this file by adding more test cases then use jest -j 10 (or npm t) in the terminal, it will run only those added as independent groups of dependencies
    // Test Cases: Here write all different scenarios that your app can handle. Include positive and negative scenario for inputs/cases like null or undefined etc., edge cases where input is a string with special characters (like "/?%^&*()_+|}{":../../...'), numbers too large, integers only
    it('GET /items returns all items', async () => { // This test checks if the GET '/' route for returning list of item(s) works correctly. 'it'. The first parameter is a string with description about what needs to be done and second one should contain callback function where we write our expectations
        const response = await request(router).get('/items');  // Calling your express Router, sending GET Request (or whatever method you use like POST or PUT) using supertest module. 'await' is used here because the result of async operation will be handled by JEST which returns a promise for us to work with asynchronously
        expect(response.status).toBe(200); // Asserts if response status code equals 200 (OK) and also verifies content type matches our expectations so that browser can understand the result of server request in json format, this is done by comparing 'content-type' header with expected value
        expect(response.body).toEqual([{ id: 1, name: "Book" }]); // Asserts if response body equals a list containing object which matches our expectations and also verifies status code to be equal (200) so browser can understand the result of server request in json format
    });  
});    
```      
Please note that this is just an example. You should adapt it according to your needs, especially regarding error handling or additional details you wish for each specific test case block such as more comprehensive data testing with multiple scenarios etc...  Also remember the imports and exportations in place are important when using jest+supertest OR any other unit/integration tests.
