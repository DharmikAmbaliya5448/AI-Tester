// AI-GENERATED TESTS START
Here are the test cases for your `router` module using jest testing framework in NodeJS environment you provided above mentioned rules as an expert on JavaScript programming assistant AI model of Deepseek Company based primarily around computer science and related topics : 
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { router, resetItems } = require("../../../server/routes/router"); // Importing the required module from server's routes folder. Assuming that your main file is `index` which includes this route in a variable called 'router'. 
let app; let req: any; let res: any;
beforeEach(()=> {   resetItems(); })//Reset items before each test case to avoid duplication of data on tests due to setup instructions.    }); //Setup the express server and define request object, response objects for testing purpose using jest's require  functionality.. Required function is defined in previous code block so just copied here with correct path
afterEach(()=> { app = null; req=null ; res=  null })//Clean up after each test case to avoid left over data on tests. Setup the express server and define request object, response objects for testing purpose using jest's require  functionality.. Required function is defined in previous code block so just copied here with correct path
beforeAll(()=> { app =express(); req=null; res=  null })//Setup before all test cases on every file run. Setup the express server and define request object, response objects for testing purpose using jest's require  functionality.. Required function is defined in previous code block so just copied here with correct path
afterAll(()=> {}) //Clean up after All tests are completed to avoid left over data on final test run. Setup the express server and define request object, response objects for testing purpose using jest's require  functionality.. Required function is defined in previous code block so just copied here with correct path
//Test cases start from Here...     'describe', it('test name'), expect(), etc are used to group tests. Each test case should be independent of others and pass or fail at the end, respectively    }); //All Test Cases Goes Heres …..      
```  ```javascript'': (()=> {const newItem ={id:2 ,name:"NewBook"}; describe('GET /items', () => {'it("should return all items", async () => 
{}); it ("Should return a specific item by id ",async function(){}) // Test Cases Goes Here ….. });});`````   This is just an example, you can write your test cases as per the requirement of each endpoint. Write positive and negative tests for both happy path (success) & edge case scenarios in this file
